## Gl√ºhwein (Mulled Wine)

Sort of based off [another recipe](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/mulled-wine-recipe/).

**Tools:**

- Sauce pan or pot with a lid
- Strainer
- Thermometer

**Ingredients:**

* 3l wine (Costco boxed Cabernet Sauvignon or Pinot Grigio)
* 1/2 cup Grand Marnier
* 2 whole oranges
* 12 whole cloves
* 3 cinnamon sticks
* 8 tbsp maple syrup (or agave or honey, but then it's a different amount)

**Quantity adjustments:**

If you base this off less or more wine, the rest of the ingredients don't scale the same. For example, here is the list for 750ml:

* 750ml wine (Costco boxed Cabernet Sauvignon or Pinot Grigio)
* 1/4 cup Grand Marnier
* 1 whole orange
* 8 whole cloves
* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 2 tbsp maple syrup

**Cooking:**

1. Cut oranges into six slices each, do not peel
1. Combine all the ingredients in a sauce pan or pot
1. Heat on high to 70C while stirring occasionally, then immediately reduce to lowest heat
1. Simmer on lowest heat for 1-2hrs. **Do not** let it heat past 70C to avoid losing precious alcohol!
1. Taste test, add maple syrup/honey and Grand Marnier to taste
1. Filter out and discard the solids. Keep the orange slices if you'll eat them - I do!
1. Drink!
