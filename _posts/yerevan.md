I lived in Yerevan for the month of November 2021. These are my findings and notes.

## Overall

Locals learn Armenian as the first language, Russian as the second and English as the third. In the city, it's easy to get by with English but folks will take advantage of those who don't know local pricing and culture. Speaking Russian helps and certainly expands the tourism horizon to most of Armenia. Unless you're good at communicating through body language, that is.

People in this country are extremely accepting of tourists from really anywhere: however, the LGBT community is just barely tolerated. Religion is widespread.

Folks drink and smoke a bit more than in the States. Currently it's still allowed to smoke in restaurants and bars, but there are usually separate sections for such activities.

There's a constant war with Azerbaijan and Turkey. Things have been relatively safe, but locals are in perpetual mourning over lost lives and lands over the years. Being cognizant of these facts as a visitor is invaluable.

While I didn't stay here, I did come in for meals and tea while working. Quiet, simple, high-quality.

A great place to come in, buy a bottle of wine off the shelf, munch on some cheese plates.

A bar/club hidden under a park in the city. Seek out the signs with its name and head downstairs for excellent food and drinks!

### [A random Jazz club](https://yandex.ru/maps/-/CCUBUKeFwA)

The name of this Jazz club is unfortunately lost in my notes, but it's thoroughly enjoyable. There's usually a cover when bands play, drinks are good and there's food available as well.
