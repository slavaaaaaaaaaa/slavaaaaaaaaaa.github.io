Are you **maximizing** a **fulfilling** environment for your engineers?

**This isn't DevEx (Developer Experience)**: a discipline of maximizing engineer performance through quality tooling, automations, and Technical Operations support. This is an expansion on the DevEx philosophy focusing on what both managers and engineers can do to have the best experience working in an engineering department.

## An engineer's needs

The goal of this blog post is a discussion of retention of talent most crucial to a company's engineering success and progress. In other words, we're talking about a long-term game for engineers.

![Engineer's needs pyramid](/assets/posts/engex-engineer-needs.png)

Placed on a hierarchy of needs, an engineer's primary needs are high quality interactions. Not to say that engineer's paycheck can be fully substituted by kindness: rather, the former can't replace the latter in a long term proposition.

From another point of view, the higher you get in the pyramid, the more short-term the solutions will become. Lower, more basic offerings, satisfy longer-term needs.

In terms of leadership effort, the less the impact, the less the effort it is to provide: increasing a paycheck in a toxic team culture is a click of a button, whereas fixing or creating kind engineering culture takes months-long effort from multiple levels of leaders.

In the next sections, we'll break down what each section implies and examples of missing the mark.

### Communication

<img align="right" src="/assets/posts/engex-communication.png">

Communication is the most crucial component of engineer experience: it's the good and bad of every day that affects us most. This includes interactions with peers, with leadership, with the immediate manager. This is also a question of whether managers, peers, and leadership have the back of their reports and peers: in client interactions, conversations around merit, raises, promotions. **Engineers and their manager and peers don't have to like each other: but there must be mutual, equal respect and clarity of value**. Most importantly, purpose of every action has to be clear.

Some of the questions you may ask yourself on this topic include:

1. Is there a feedback loop with regular surveys? Are the findings discussed with all levels of leadership, with clear next steps and improvements? Are the latter communicated to the engineers and followed up on? Are these surveys truly anonymous? Read: *do they feel anonymous to engineers?*
1. Is there regular communication between *the entire* engineering team, globally? Is anyone left out?
1. Is upper leadership paying attention to the quality of *people management* that people managers perform? How?

### Daily routine

<img align="right" src="/assets/posts/engex-daily-routine.png">

Daily routine refers to largely three categories:

1. Ease of engineering
1. Bureaucracies
1. Projects

Let's break these down.

#### Ease of engineering

This mildly intersects with the upcoming **Growth** section. It's crucial for engineering members to be able to perform research and development with ease, to test approaches to problems outside of client or production environments. Engineers should also be motivated to talk about these achievements, and share findings through demos. Unless core intellectual property would be exposed, or business would come to harm, these demos should be public and external: this helps company visibility of high quality engineering culture, and promotes engineer growth and visibility.

#### Bureaucracies

Bureaucracies is the word I use for daily processes that are a business need: filling out time sheets, submitting and tracking PTO. Additionally, this is the ease of following policies and any other painful but necessary "busy work". As leadership, it's crucial to facilitate these processes through internal automation as much as possible. **Every extra step required is a risk of someone not following the process properly, or at all**. 

#### Projects

Hands-on engineering work is the kind that requires periods of unbroken focus time. Every instance of broken focus or workflow is a danger to job satisfaction and progress. Pain points for time management not only include meetings, and queries from coworkers, but also context switching between tasks: both long and short term. Consider the kinds of tasks that one can switch between every few hours, days, weeks. The most ideal project allocations are 100%: every combination of smaller allocations will decrease productivity and toil. **Two 50% project allocations don't add up to 100%: rather, 120%**. 

Some ways you kind find your pain points in this section are asking yourself:

1. How difficult is it for an engineer to create a fresh environment and deploy infrastructure? How long does it take and how many people does she have to talk to?
1. Are the systems you use primarily engineer-friendly?
1. Are regular company processes automated? For those processes that remain manual: how many steps does it take to complete it from beginning to end?
1. How much documentation is there around policies and onboarding? How much of it is transferred through word of mouth? How realistic is it that every engineer knows all of it and is up-to-date on every change that's made?
1. Do engineers get disrupted often? Are internal meetings flexible in timing? Is engineers' time maximized for heads-down work?
1. How often are engineers overallocated? Are the same ones consistently doing this? Is the business need clear and obvious?
1. Do engineers enjoy the work they're asked to do?
1. Is there a feedback loop for engineer satisfaction in this section?

### Growth

<img align="right" src="/assets/posts/engex-growth.png">

When we talk about growth, we're referring to personal and professional growth an engineer can take home and use in the future. All members of an organization must always be motivated to grow their skills: social, business, and technical. It's understandable that this may not happen every single moment of a given time period, but when one looks back at a time frame of quarters and years, **growth should be obvious** to both the leadership and the subject.

For engineers, most of their growth comes from direct management: through motivation, and clarity of business needs. Immediate managers have to be deeply and closely involved in *people management*: without this core practice, growth is entirely on the shoulders of their reporting engineers, who may or may not have insight of business needs or direction. The most basic practice of regular 1:1s is too often ignored by managers: while some engineers can find their own path, others cannot, and will be left stagnating. **It's up to the managers to ensure that their reports know exactly where and how to grow, until they develop that skill for themselves**.

Growth can be both internally and externally visible: both are necessary. Internal visibility is success in the role: bringing in a difficult client, delivering a knowledge-sharing session, creating novel intellectual property. Examples of externally visible growth are regular blog posts, Github account activity, attendance of conferences and meetups, promotions. Widely shared, external visibility will reach internal circles and benefit the engineer in company growth; the inverse applies. When such sharing isn't possible (for example, when external growth isn't useful internally, or when security clearances are in effect), both are necessary to maximize visibility throughout.

Visibility is an often overlooked necessity of today's market, used to identify technical and social strength. When an employee and their successes aren't immediately obvious internally (either because of lack of business impact or a lack of their leadership publicizing it), that puts a target on their back. When an engineer's visibility isn't obvious externally, it harms their future employment prospects. 

Finally, upper leadership, IT Support, and Human Resources are all responsible for availability of R&D environments, learning materials, and learning and development funds to facilitate growth.

Some questions around this section are:

* Is your organization gathering and acting upon feedback from employees? Is there a regular feedback loop on the following subjects: 
    * Immediate people management: effectiveness, growth enablement, regular 1:1s
    * Motivation of personal growth
    * Clarity of business needs and direction
* Are there clear metrics for measuring People Managers' performance?
* Does upper leadership have clear buy-in for growth, learning, and development? *Is it effective?*
* Are engineers both internally and externally visible? Is there a discrepancy of whose reports are more or less visible? Is there a *leadership* problem or an *individual contributor* problem?
* Are engineers enabled to be externally visible: do they have Technical Writer support, are their Github accounts forced to be separated from their personal accounts?
* How difficult is it to spend learning and development funds? Are there boundaries or difficult processes?
* How difficult is it to create and use a research-and-development environment?

### Compensation

<img align="right" src="/assets/posts/engex-compensation.png">

At the top of the pyramid is compensation. When we're talking about increasing or decreasing it from a set target, that target is market value. What are comparable levels earning at different companies, including base, bonus, and stock? What could this exact engineer, with their skill level and social skills, be earning elsewhere?

As this is at the top of the pyramid, I argue that while this is the factor simplest for leadership to provide, it's also the least impactful attribute of work for an engineer's long term commitment to the role. Consider an engineer whose other needs in the pyramids are unfulfilled: their communications are lacking or toxic, their day-to-day is full of tedious manual processes and repetitive tasks, they don't feel like they're growing their personal, social, or professional skills they'd be able to use elsewhere. This causes stagnation, ignorance, lower quality work, and ideally, the engineer would leave before they lose too much of themselves.

While this category is least valued, it's still necessary. In the current state of affairs, it's expected that engineers discuss their salaries with their peers and senior members of the company. Resources like [Levels.FYI](https://levels.fyi), [H1B Salary Database](https://h1bdata.info), [GlassDoor](https://glassdoor.com) are available for everyone to find their approximate value in the market. **Your most valuable engineers (confident, skillful, with excellent business acumen) tend to be the best at ensuring their growth and at interviewing**. There must always be a clear reason for differences in compensation.

Some questions you should ask yourself are:

* Do your people managers have visibility and control of their reports salaries?
* Does everyone in your organization have a clear understanding of the disparity in their compensation, whether low or high?
* Do engineers' raises have clear parity with merit?

## Conclusion

You'll notice how often I've used the word feedback in this proposal. Three of the four most important parts of the pyramid are largely supported by a constant feedback loop: 

1. Solicit feedback through anonymous survey.
1. Provide the findings to upper leadership, through Human Resources for any necessary filtering or rewording to ensure retaliation by leaders is impossible.
1. Discuss the findings with direct leaders: positive feedback should be public, negative feedback should have engagement and follow-through.
1. Discuss all filtered feedback with the engineers: present improvement plans, provide regular updates.
1. Repeat regularly, depending on severity.

Finally, everything in this proposal depends on all levels of the company hierarchy: Engineers, People Managers, Upper Leadership. All three groups, all individuals have to be on-board.
